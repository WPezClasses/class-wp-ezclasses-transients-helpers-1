##### WordPress transients done The ezWay. 

Centralize your transients (and their definitions and settings) and treat them more like methods / functions. And by using a static method
you can access your transients from just about anywhere.

#### Overview

With this approach / structure, all = or at least most - of your transients can defined and managed via a single centralized class. 

For example, most blog posts on how to use transients show the get, the if (i.e., is the transient value still available) and the recalculation (of the transient) all in the same spot, and quite possibly repeated throughout your code. Obviously, that gets messy. Additionally, chances are the logic / rules for the delete transients is elsewhere as well.  Again, more possible disconnect.  

With this new & improved approach (i.e., The ezWay), via a single static get all that  is necessary is done for you. Well okay, you have to set it up, but the point is you do your get and these helpers enable the handling of the rest for you. Has the requested transient expired? No problem. You don't need to know, nor do you care. You just need the value.

Or if the definition of the calculation for the value changes - say, a different WP_Query - you know exactly where to make that update. No more sprawl, or ideally a lot less. 

```
######The Bonus Round

In theory, it's possible to include your globals / constants along with your transient centralizing, and just use active => false, since you (probably) don't actually need a transients.

For example, perhaps you're using an array of some (more of less) fixed set of values in multiple places across your site / application / project. Since the ultimate purpose here is centralization, as well as easy of use / maintenance, it might make sense to define that array along with your transients. Then you have a single goto class to lean on for common / universal values.

And if for some reason a fixed array becomes more dynamic (read: database driven) then all you have to do is update the method that does the value and make active => true. Bingo! You've got a transient.

```

You can also define when a transient should be deleted. For example, if a particular post_type is updated (i.e., action: save_post) you can have transients that need that lean on that update / post_type be deleted (indirectly) by that save_post event. 

You can also "automate" the creation of transients that are based on post ID and user ID. Again, you define what you need and once that's done all you have to really worry about is using the transient (via a static get). 

Think less. Do more. The ezWay.
